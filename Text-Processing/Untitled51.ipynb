        "Text processing refers to the manipulation, analysis, and transformation of textual data using various computational techniques. It involves applying algorithms and methods to extract meaningful information from raw text, making it more structured, readable, and suitable for further analysis or use in applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text processing tasks can vary widely depending on the specific goals and requirements. Some common text processing tasks include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Text Cleaning: Removing unnecessary characters, formatting, or noise from the text, such as punctuation, HTML tags, or special characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual units, such as words or sentences, called tokens. Tokenization is a fundamental step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Stop Word Removal: Filtering out common words (e.g., \"a,\" \"the,\" \"is\") that carry little meaning and are often removed to focus on more relevant content.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normalization: Transforming text to a standard form, such as converting all characters to lowercase, removing accents or diacritical marks, or expanding abbreviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Lemmatization and Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form. Lemmatization aims for the base dictionary form (lemma), while stemming cuts off prefixes or suffixes to achieve a rough approximation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to words, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., to understand their syntactic role in a sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as person names, locations, organizations, dates, or numerical expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, typically classified as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Text Classification: Assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents based on their content. This can involve tasks like topic classification, spam detection, or sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Information Extraction: Identifying structured information from unstructured text, such as extracting names, dates, locations, or key phrases from a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text processing can be performed using programming languages like Python, along with libraries and frameworks such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), spaCy, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow. These tools provide pre-built functionalities and models for various text processing tasks, making it easier to analyze and work with textual data efficiently."
